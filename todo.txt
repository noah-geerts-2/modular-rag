- Make unit/integration testing consistent for integrations like pinecone and openai API (thinking of pinecone_vector_store, pinecone_reranker, multimodal_loader_chunker, and multi_query_rewriter)
- Add some testing to multi_query_rewriter
- Create PromptConstructor type and a concrete implementation
- Implement RetrievalPipeline class

- Some refactoring.. maybe think about whether k values should be in constructors or functions, and whether the Chunk type should
contain an ID for simplicity, and whether the SemanticCandidate should be renamed
